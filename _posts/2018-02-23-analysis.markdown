<h1>Differentiability between vector spaces</h1>

Some key ideas 

<h1>Contraction mapping and the solution of equations</h1>

The solution of multivariable equations can be analysed with the following key results: 

<ul>
<li><b>The contraction principle</b>: maps which contract distances have a unique fixed point</li>
<li><b>The inverse function theorem</b>: maps at a point with an invertible derivative are locally invertible at that point, and the inverse is actually continuously differentiable</li>
<li><b>The implicit function theorem</b></li>
<li><b>Picard's theorem'</b></li>
</ul>
