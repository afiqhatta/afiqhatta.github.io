Sometimes I like to do these "mindmap" writings to map out the story of linear algebra, just to make my thinking clearer. 

<b>
Thoughts on symmetric bilinear forms
</b>

I think there's inherently quite a nice picture when it comes to bilinear forms. A bilinear form is just a map taking to vectors in the vector-space to some number (or field as we usually call it). This map is linear in both argument.s Which means, that we "fix" a vector in the pair, then that map is linear in in the other side. 

Let's study a certain type of bilinear form, the symmetric one. This would be a map;
